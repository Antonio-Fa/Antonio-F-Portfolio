# Antonio-F-Portfolio

This portfolio project was made using only html and scss. I went with a single webpage design to hopefully create some interesting animations in the future with page transitions.

Work will continue to be done on this portfolio site and may go through drastic changes in the future or keep core designs used here in this current version. This version is mainly composed of flex boxes within flex boxes to create the individual page areas along with the content inside. There is still room for improvement and will be improved upon in the coming weeks.
